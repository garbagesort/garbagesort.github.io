            <h2>3. Notice Regarding Dispute Resolution</h2>
            These ToS contain provisions that govern how claims you and we may have against each other are resolved,
            including an agreement and obligation to arbitrate disputes, which, subject to limited exceptions, will require
            you to submit claims you have against us to binding arbitration, unless you opt-out of arbitration as described
            below. If you do not opt-out of arbitration, you will only be permitted to pursue claims and seek relief
            (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) against us on an individual basis, not as part of any
            class or representative action or proceeding.
            <h2>4. Updates to these ToS</h2> We may modify these ToS from time to time. We will notify you of material
            changes in accordance with applicable laws. If you do not agree with the proposed changes, you should
            discontinue your use of the Service and uninstall the App. If you continue using the Service after the new terms
            take effect, you will be bound by the modified ToS
            <h2>5. Force Majeure</h2>
            The Company will not be responsible for any failure to perform its obligations under this TOS due to
            circumstances beyond its reasonable control including, without limitation, acts of God, war, riot, terrorism,
            embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, flood, or accidents.
            <h2>6. Independent Contractors.</h2>
            Nothing in these ToS shall be deemed to create an agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee or
            franchisor-franchisee relationship of any kind between us and any user.
